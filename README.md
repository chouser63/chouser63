# Hi, I'm Chase 👋  

I'm a rising second-year **Computer Science and Business Administration** student at Northeastern University with a deep passion for learning new things.  

🚴 In the past, I've worked as a **bike mechanic**, a **home automation technician**, and co-managed a local **charity that donated refurbished bicycles**.  

💻 Currently, I'm a **full-stack web developer** at NEU's Khoury College, working on *Odyssey*, a Khoury-specific learning platform.  
🔍 I'm particularly interested in using **AWS** to build full-stack applications using services like **EC2**, **S3**, and **RDS**
